gpu-monitor
===========

Monitor your NVIDIA GPU online with Plotly.

Usage
-----

In Windows, you'll need to set the PATH to your nvidia-smi executable. You'll also need a [Plotly](http://plot.ly) account and your own **stream tokens** and modify `gpu-monitor.pyw` accordingly.

Once done, just run `gpu-monitor.pyw`.
